Needed Enhancements

There are several areas in the DIMS development architecture that are
more complex than is desirable, where things are difficult to use and
bugs often get in the way.  As the quote above atests, it is a challenge
to make things simple, elegant, and robust. Given limited resources,
time deadlines, and pressures to get things working, some components
of the DIMS project have attained the success of a prototype and
are now in need of reimplementation as a cleaner, tighter, next
major version.  This section describes some of those components
and thoughts on what to do next.
